# Login and Sign-Up Form

This project is a responsive login and sign-up form inspired by CodingLab's Responsive Login and Signup Form tutorial. While the design draws inspiration from CodingLab, I've incorporated best practices for HTML and CSS that I learned from Dave Gray's tutorial videos on Semantic HTML Tags, HTML Forms and Inputs, and How to Organize CSS.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML**: Utilized appropriate HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Organized CSS**: Structured the CSS code to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the form adapts well to different screen sizes.
- **User-Friendly**: Clear labels, error handling, and intuitive design for a smooth user experience.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Added dynamic behavior using JavaScript for form submission, validation, and user interaction.
